#### Noto Emoji with Blobs enabled

This repository is intended to continue the development of the Blob emojis which have been abandoned by the original creators in 2017.

My goal is to upgrade the Blob emojis with a fresh style which is consistent to other emoji vendors.

Another thing is that this emoji set includes some emojis and ZWJ-sequences which are not part of the current emoji standard (although some or most of them are about to be included in the upcoming Unicode-standard), which means it might be one of the biggest emoji sets currently available!
NotoColorEmoji fonts are provided by [C1710's project](https://github.com/C1710/blobmoji).
